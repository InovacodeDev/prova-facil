-- =====================================================
-- INDEXES FOR POLICY PERFORMANCE
-- =====================================================
-- These indexes help RLS policies perform better
-- Index for auth.uid() lookups on profiles
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_auth_uid ON profiles (id);

-- Index for assessment ownership checks
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assessments_user_id ON assessments (user_id);

-- Index for question ownership through assessments
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_questions_assessment_for_auth ON questions (assessment_id);

-- =====================================================
-- NOTES
-- =====================================================
-- 1. Admin functionality is controlled by profiles.is_admin column.
--    To make a user admin:
--    UPDATE profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE id = '<user-uuid>';
--
-- 2. Service role bypasses RLS automatically. Use it for:
--    - Migrations
--    - Seed data
--    - Background jobs
--    - Admin operations
--
-- 3. Test policies with:
--    SET ROLE authenticated;
--    SET request.jwt.claim.sub = '<user-uuid>';
--    -- Run queries to test
--    RESET ROLE;
--
-- 4. To view all policies:
--    SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';
--
-- 5. Error logs use context->>'userId' instead of a dedicated user_id column.
--    This allows flexible error tracking for both authenticated and anonymous users.
